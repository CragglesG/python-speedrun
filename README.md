# Python Speedrun

This repo contains resources to host a call to speedrun learning Python. Do you know someone who needs help learning to code? You can use this repo to give them some assistance!

## How It Works

The resources are divided into 3 sections: Complete Beginner, Foundations, and Making a Program. You can use the resources separately, or together. If your attendees have never used Python before, you should start with the Complete Beginner section. If they have basic Python knowledge, you should start with the Fundamentals section. If they are familiar with Python but have never made a real program before, you should start with the Making a Program section.
